//General IFF reader, but intended for LWOB reading.
//Adding writing ability, for general data file stuff.
//TODO: Nested chunks.
//Done:  Multiple chunks of the same type allowed in a file.  Still no nesting.

//Must link with wsock32.lib for conversion macros.  All
//data stored on disk in Network (big endian) format.

//Ok, read up on the IFF spec.  FORM<size> is a chunk, so <size> includes the
//following form <type>.  Then it's <chunk type><chunk size> as I thought, with
//<chunk size> including only data bytes past the header.  There's nothing
//mentioned about sub-chunks or nesting, so NewTek must have added some custom
//stuff to their chunks.  Also the spec calls for all short/long data to be
//aligned on an even byte.  Argh!  There shouldn't be any problem with reading
//unaligned 4 byte blocks from a disk file for pete's sake, so I might just
//ignore that part of the standard.  This is mostly for internal file formats
//anyway.  But to be fully compatible with e.g. writing LWOBs...  Drat.  Ok,
//my file formats look safe at the moment, so internal to the chunk finding
//evening will be automatic, but within each chunk evening is up to the app.
